# About
Airbnb currently has more than 5 million hosts and more than 7.7 million active listings. Some of these listings are highly profitable and some are not. In this exploratory project, we are driven in identifying factors that contributes to an Airbnb listing's success. This repository dives into the world of Airbnb listings in Toronto. We perform EDA along with basic supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms such as linear regression and K-means clustering.

## Key Questions
1. What is the distribution of superhost?
2. Which neighbourhoods are most populas and which neighbourhoods have higher pricing?
3. What is the relationship between number of bedrooms offered and pricing of a listing?
4. What is the distribution of property type and room type in Toronto?
5. Is there any relationship between property type and price? Which property type are costly?
6. Do customers prefer lower minimum nights or higher minimum nights?
7. Which listings are most successful?
