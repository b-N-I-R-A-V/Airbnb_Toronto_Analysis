# About
Airbnb currently has more than 5 million hosts and more than 7.7 million active listings. Some of these listings are highly profitable and some are not. In this exploratory project, we are driven in identifying factors that contributes to an Airbnb listing's success. This repository dives into the world of Airbnb listings in Toronto. We perform EDA along with basic supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms such as linear regression and K-means clustering.

## Key Questions
1. What is the distribution of superhost?
2. Which neighbourhoods are most populas and which neighbourhoods have higher pricing?
3. What is the relationship between number of bedrooms offered and pricing of a listing?
4. What is the distribution of property type and room type in Toronto?
5. Is there any relationship between property type and price? Which property type are costly?
6. Do customers prefer lower minimum nights or higher minimum nights?
7. Which listings are most successful?

## Data Source
This data source is external. It was collected by insideairbnb.com and not published by Airbnb itself. The website however is not endorsing nor associated with Airbnb or itsâ€™ competition. The website claims that the data compiled is for public analysis, discussion, and community website. In my opinion, I think we can consider this data set as trustworthy since it is collected from Airbnb and due transparency is shown by Inside Airbnb.

##Data Sets:
1. [Toronto Listings Data set](https://data.insideairbnb.com/canada/on/toronto/2024-05-09/data/listings.csv.gz)
2. [GeoJSON file of Neighbourhoods in Toronto](https://data.insideairbnb.com/canada/on/toronto/2024-05-09/visualisations/neighbourhoods.geojson)

## Data Limitations and Challenges
I noticed that 25% of the price were missing in the original data set. This was challenging as I wanted to predict price of an Airbnb listing and imputing the price using any technique would have defeated the purpose of doing so. To handle these missing values I had to remove theem from the dataset. This may have skewed the data in one direction or another and may case bias in the data. Therefore, results of this analysis can be interpreted with caution. The primary goal of the project was to practice skills with machine learning algorithms.


## Tableau Dashboard and Story
I have added the most important visualizations on Tableau public to make it easy for the stakeholders understand the story of Toronto Airbnb listings. Note that, not all the visualizations have been added to the Tableau dashboard.
